 * The shell as the browser host: what answers a session's browser asks.

 * owns the browser process, the profile and the driver - so this module is
 * the one place the two meet.
 *
 * **The capability is declared only where a host is really there.** A page
 * opened outside the shell (the dev server in a plain browser, where nothing
 * answers `invoke`) must not claim it: an ask routed to a client that cannot
 * serve it arrives as a session's tool call failing, which is a lie about the
 * session rather than about the page.
