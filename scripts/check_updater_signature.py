"""Check a built update tarball's signature against the pinned public key.

Usage: check_updater_signature.py <repo-root> <version>

The Tauri CLI signs with whatever key `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` names, and
only WARNS when that key is not the one `tauri.conf.json` pins - a mismatched
key signs happily, the recipe would print its OK line, and every installed
desktop would then refuse the artifact at install time (fail-closed, so the
release is dead on arrival rather than dangerous). The pair is read back and
compared here instead, the way `client-android-release` reads the built APK's
signer back against its keystore.

Reads the pinned `pubkey` from `<root>/client/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and
the signature from the app bundle's `forge.app.tar.gz.sig`. Both are base64
of a minisign text file whose second line decodes to a blob carrying the
eight-byte key id at offset 2; the signature's trusted comment carries the
version the artifact was signed for.
